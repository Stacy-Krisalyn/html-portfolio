 <h2>Top three movies that I've watched</h2>
 <hr />
 <h3>Tangled</h3>
 <p>This is one of the most wonderful movies I have watched. It has got
    various emotions packed up in a perfect balance.<br />
    With loads of love and subtle romance of course.
 </p>
 <h3>Sita Raman</h3>
 <p>It's a beautiful love story. It is a fictional story
    potraying the beauty of love between a princess and a soldier.<br />
    The reason I liked the movie was beacuse it potrays love
    with purity rather than vulgarity.
 </p>
 <h3>Amaran</h3>
 <p>Its a story of a soldier. But also
    about an ordinary girl turning to be brave rather than 
    the old sensetive self.
