<h1>About Me</h1>
<p>I am an ordinary girl with loads of imagination and ideas. I am an extrovert,
   which isn't my character but i developed it cause i wasn't comfortable
   with my introverted self.
</p>

<p>I wanna explore many new things and places. I love to travel the world 
  and enjoy my life to the fullest. My hobbies are to cook food that I love,
  sing, dance and importantly sketch. I am trying to master realistic sketching.
</p>

<p>I am quite regiligious. But I would not look down on another religion.
  I also can't tolerate when others look down on my religion.
  I give more priority to improve my spirituality. But I also believe that 
  in order to get closer to God, you need to first love other people, because 
  God is love and without love there is no God. So, just love everyone but 
  also don't give them a chance to take you for granted. I know that I sound 
  a bit philosophical, but this doesn't make me a boring person because I am
  a good listener. <br />
  Thats all about me. Thank you for reading. <br />
